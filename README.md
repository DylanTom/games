# Games
Run Command:
```python
python games
```

This package is formatted in such a way to easily extend to handle multiple
games. Running `__main__.py` enables a text-based UI with a menu of games 
available. Currently, for sudoku, the only way to input a board is manually. 

To run the EASY test board, 
```python
python games EASY
```

To run the HARD test board,
```python
python games HARD
```
